# marvel-react
React-redux basic example project

The project is based on create-react-app

I did it in 3 hours so there are a lot of things to I wish I could make cleaner

Also I would have gladly deployed it directly on surge.sh.

But the private key should stay private, should it ?

## Steps

- duplicate src/config/default.json and rename it to env.json
- fill up env.json with the right keys
- install `yarn`
- start `yarn start`

- call me, send a mail, choose a time for a drink, to give me feedback !

...Well I wanted to deploy on surge.sh, but all the code is visible, like the keys.
